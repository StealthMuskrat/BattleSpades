Total: **1,304 passed; zero failures, errors or skips.**

New source comparisons: 18,124 geometry/segment vectors, 822 selection/rescue/score
events, 16,000 random operations, 3,064 hypot and 3,000 compensated-sum vectors.
All 18 class movers settle resolved spawns through 8,640 exact original-engine
ticks, including flags and landing returns. The new UDP test removes terrain
under a first admission and verifies safe placement on the next join.

The focused original retail-box/smart-spawn/TDM/spawn-lock subset passes 42 tests.
Earlier source-name/admission/rule/scene/movement/query and UDP gates remain covered.
See [SPAWNING.md](SPAWNING.md) and [FEATURE_PARITY.md](FEATURE_PARITY.md).
Full Character lifecycle, sidecar assembly, actual modes, input/equipment timing,
combat and playable hosting remain pending.

Fresh packaged-JAR native transport and configured-loader probes pass nominal
and impaired/private scenarios, including loss/reorder/duplicates, full/delta map
loading, canonical catch-up and scene reloads. These remain test endpoints, not
supported-original-game-client sessions.
